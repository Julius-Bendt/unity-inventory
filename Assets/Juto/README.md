# Juto Standard Assets


## What is this?
The Juto Standard Assets are the assets we often use in our games.

## Why?
The Assets are mainly being developed to get some work on our resume.

## How?
You'll need to setup a project, and import text mesh pro.

## Which?
The package will include the following assets when done (they may not be completed in that order):

### Input manager
Functions as the normal Input.GetAxis(), but the keys can be changed during
runtime.

### Audio player
Play an audioclip with one line of code.

### Object pooling
Instantiate takes a lot of performance. So instead of doing it while in-game, we
create a lot in the start of the game and reuse them.

### UI-transitions/effects
- Fade
- Smooth lerp
- Text-adder
- Color fade

## Following might be moved to another pack

### City/terrain builder
Perlin based builder.

### Traffic Manager
Allows cars to follow a specific path to look like a real-world traffic.

### A-star
“simple” a star.

### Build-system
Runtime build system. Both grid and dynamic.

### RTS kit
Simple setup, and ready to go RTS kit.




## EDITOR EXTENSIONS
