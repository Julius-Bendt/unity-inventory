# Unity Inventory

## Description:
I started developing the inventory early 2020.
It featured a inventory, and I started creating a crafting system (3x3).
I lost interrest when I had to make some custom editors for unity, to easily create new recipes. 

Press 'I' to toggle the inventory

i MIGHT reopen this project again if I get the time, however it is highly unlikely.

## Warning:
Some assets have been removed, and others haven't been updated. This could result in a lot of errors!

## Setup:
Either clone the reposity, or import the unity package file.<br>
The latest unity version tested: UNITY_2019.4.11f1<br>
However, newer version *should* work.
